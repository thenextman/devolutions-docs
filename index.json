    "keywords": "Getting Started Prerequisites Docker Installation Install the DevolutionsGateway PowerShell module: Install-Module -Name DevolutionsGateway Import-Module DevolutionsGateway Configuration Create the Devolutions Gateway configuration directory if it doesn't already exists: PS > Import-Module DevolutionsGateway PS > Get-DGatewayPath C:\\ProgramData\\Devolutions\\Gateway PS > New-Item -Path $(Get-DGatewayPath) -ItemType 'Directory' -Force Move into the configuration directory manually, or using the Enter-DGatewayConfig command: PS > Enter-DGatewayConfig -ChangeDirectory PS C:\\ProgramData\\Devolutions\\Gateway> The Enter-DGatewayConfig command sets the DGATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH environment variable that affects all commands accepting the -ConfigPath parameter. For this guide, we will be using the standard configuration directory. Gateway Hostname By default, the Devolutions Gateway will use the default computer name ( $Env:ComputerName ) as its hostname when responding to queries. For testing on the local network, this is probably not an issue, but for external access you will need to change it to the external DNS name you intend to use: Set-DGatewayHostname 'jet.buzzword.marketing' Gateway Listeners Before launching Devolutions Gateway for the first time, it is important to configure its protocol listeners with the Set-DGatewayListeners command: Set-DGatewayListeners @( $(New-DGatewayListener 'http://*:7171' 'http://*:7171'), $(New-DGatewayListener 'tcp://*:8181' 'tcp://*:8181') ) Run Get-DGatewayListeners to see the list of configured listeners: PS > Get-DGatewayListeners InternalUrl ExternalUrl ----------- ----------- http://*:7171 http://*:7171 tcp://*:8181 tcp://*:8181 Each listener object is composed of an InternalUrl and ExternalUrl member. The internal URL is the local protocol and port on which to listen, the external URL is the external protocol and port used to expose the service externally. Use * as the \"host\" in both URLs to use an appropriate default value, unless it needs to be set explicitly to something else. The default host for the external URL is the configured gateway hostname. When using Devolutions Gateway on the local network, both URLs will generally be identical, so don't bother about it too much for now, we'll reconfigure them later for proper external access. Initial Launch Once the initial configuration is completed, the gateway can be started with the Start-DGateway command. Use the -Verbose parameter to print the full docker commands and use them for reference if you wish to launch the container directly without the DevolutionsGateway module. PS > Start-DGateway docker pull devolutions/devolutions-gateway:0.13.0-servercore-ltsc2019 Starting devolutions-gateway devolutions-gateway successfully started Make sure that the HTTP listener health check responds \"200 OK\": PS > $DGatewayUrl = 'http://localhost:7171' PS > Invoke-WebRequest \"$DGatewayUrl/health\" StatusCode : 200 StatusDescription : OK Content : {74, 101, 116, 32...} RawContent : HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 59 Date: Thu, 22 Oct 2020 19:02:07 GMT Jet instance \"jet.buzzword.marketing\" is alive and healthy. Headers : {[Content-Length, 59], [Date, Thu, 22 Oct 2020 19:02:07 GMT]} RawContentLength : 59 Certificate Configuration Now that Devolutions Gateway was launched once with success, we can reconfigure it for proper HTTPS access. Before going any further, stop Devolutions Gateway if it is currently running: Stop-DGateway A valid certificate from a known authority like letsencrypt can be obtained in various ways. The Posh-ACME PowerShell module is an excellent module with plugins for most DNS providers. For the purpose of this guide, we use a wildcard certificate for \"*.buzzword.marketing\" as opposed to \"jet.buzzword.marketing\". Using a wildcard certificate has many practical advantages, but it only becomes mandatory if you intend to deploy multiple instances of Devolutions Gateway for high availability. $CertPath = \"~\\certs\\!.buzzword.marketing\" Import-DGatewayCertificate -CertificateFile $(Join-Path $CertPath 'fullchain.pfx') -Password 'poshacme' Let's reconfigure our protocol listeners, using 'https' rather than 'http' this time: Set-DGatewayListeners @( $(New-DGatewayListener 'https://*:7171' 'https://*:7171'), $(New-DGatewayListener 'tcp://*:8181' 'tcp://*:8181') ) the 'tcp' listener remains unchanged for now, but it may use the configured certificate for certain protocols. Do you recall the Set-DGatewayHostname command? Let's confirm that the configured hostname matches the imported certificate: PS > Get-DGatewayHostname jet.buzzword.marketing Our certificate valid for \"*.buzzword.marketing\" matches the \"jet.buzzword.marketing\" hostname, so there won't be a certificate name mismatch. External Exposure The next step is to expose Devolutions Gateway externally on that domain name. If you have an Azure VM directly exposed to the internet, add the required inbound firewall exception. In other environments, this is done with a simple port forward in your router. If you use a reverse proxy with TLS offloading, we will cover the differences later. For this guide, I have configured an Azure VM directly exposed on the internet with a public IP. The \"buzzword.marketing\" domain was configured with an A record for 'jet' pointing to the Azure VM public IP. With this in mind, let's explain a little more the internal and external URLs: InternalUrl : 'https://*:7171' expands to 'https://0.0.0.0:7171', which means \"listen locally in HTTPS on all network interfaces, on port 7171\". ExternalUrl : 'https://*:7171' expands to \"https://jet.buzzword.marketing:7171\" which means \"accessed externally in HTTPS, on 'jet.buzzword.marketing', port 7171\" In the end, this means traffic will flow in through \"https://jet.buzzword.marketing:7171\" and reach \"https://internal-hostname:7171\" on the internal network. Validate the configuration, making sure that everything matches, then start Devolutions Gateway again: Start-DGateway Cross your fingers, then try the Devolutions Gateway health check: Invoke-WebRequest \"https://$(Get-DGatewayHostname):7171/health\" StatusCode : 200 StatusDescription : OK Content : {74, 101, 116, 32...} RawContent : HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 59 Date: Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:39:58 GMT Jet instance \"jet.buzzword.marketing\" is alive and healthy. Headers : {[Content-Length, 59], [Date, Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:39:58 GMT]} RawContentLength : 59 If the above command worked, then you have successfully configured Devolutions Gateway for external access with a valid certificate, congratulations! If not, review the previous steps to find what you missed. Reverse Proxy Instead of configuring Devolutions Gateway to handle HTTPS with a certificate, a reverse proxy can be put in front to handle and offload TLS entirely. This approach is preferred if multiple web applications need to be exposed through the same entry point. Reverse proxies like IIS (with ARR) , traefik, nginx and haproxy also come with advanced configuration options and better ways to handle certificate management. When using a wildcard certificate, it becomes easy to create an HTTPS listener bound to a specific domain and forward all traffic coming through this domain to Devolutions Gateway specifically. This technique is often used to make \"virtual hosts\" on the same TCP port (especially 443, the standard one) using TLS Server Name Indication (SNI). Assuming we have configured our reverse proxy to forward traffic coming in through \"https://jet.buzzword.marketing\" to our internal host where Devolutions Gateway is listening in HTTP on port 7171, the new configuration should look like this: Set-DGatewayListeners @( $(New-DGatewayListener 'http://*:7171' 'https://*'), $(New-DGatewayListener 'tcp://*:8181' 'tcp://*:8181') ) Notice that in this case, the internal URL is set to 'http', because it receives traffic in HTTP from the reverse proxy. The reverse proxy handles HTTPS, offloads TLS, then forwards the traffic in HTTP to Devolutions Gateway. Because of this, the network path taken between the reverse proxy and the target host on the local network should be restricted. You can also choose to offload TLS, yet forward traffic over HTTPS on the internal network with a second TLS connection, but this is definitely not a requirement. This type of configuration is generally more difficult to implement and comes with an additional performance cost. Before going that route, consider not doing TLS offloading in the first place, and letting Devolutions Gateway handle it instead with better performance. Last but not least, the TCP listener also needs a corresponding port forwarding configuration. In this case, TCP/8181 on jet.buzzword.marketing needs to be forward to TCP/8181 on the internal host where Devolutions Gateway is running. Don't forget to double check that the firewall has the proper inbound TCP port exception. Wayk Bastion If you use Wayk Bastion, you can now reconfigure it to point to your Devolutions Gateway: Set-WaykBastionConfig -JetExternal $true -JetRelayUrl \"https://jet.buzzword.marketing:7171\" Restart-WaykBastion Automatic Startup If you launched Devolutions Gateway in a container, you don't need to do anything, as the default Docker restart policy is set to 'always'. This can be changed with the Set-DGatewayConfig command: Set-DGatewayConfig -DockerRestartPolicy \"on-failure\" Unlike \"always\", the \"on-failure\" restart policy only restarts the container if it fails with a non-zero exit code."

    "keywords": "Wayk Agent Performance Performance Metrics The performance of the peer-to-peer connection to the Wayk Agent is largely driven by two factors: capture performance (the speed that updates can be captured), and network speed (the speed that updates can be delivered). Capture Performance On Windows 8 and newer, the screen is captured using hardware accelerated DirectX. This is at least 4-5x faster than the fallback software screen capture (GDI). It's possible to disable hardware accelerated captured by setting DXGICaptureEnabled to false (see Configuration ). Only the updated portions of the screen are transmitted to the client, and only a single display is transmitted at one time. Capture performance can be affected by the connecting client; see Client Performance . Network Performance Network performance depends greatly on workload and the number of full-screen updates that must be transmitted. Watching a full-screen video generates far more data than interacting with a terminal or file browsing. The following recommendations are based on JPEG/Low quality and are a guideline only. Agent Screen Resolution Size of full screen update (JPEG/Low) Recommended upstream bandwidth 640x480 (480p) 30KB 1Mbps 1280x720 (720p) 95KB 3Mbps 1440x900 135KB 5Mbps 1920x1080 210KB 10Mbps 3840x2160 (2160p) 850KB 25Mbps Performance Tuning To achive acceptable performance, make sure you choose a screen resolution that is achievable with the available bandwidth and configure the client performance settings according to recommendations. When using RDP virtual sessions, it's possible for the connecting client to request a specific screen resolution. See Client Performance . If the amount of data transmitted by the Agent is too high for the available bandwidth, the connection may be saturated and become laggy. The Agent will transmit frames as fast as it can capture them (which typically might be 8-15fps on modern hardware; or even higher at low resolutions). In this case, the connecting client can request a lower framerate from the Agent. See Client Performance . Start at 6fps and work down to 1fps until you find an acceptable compromise."

    "keywords": "Active Directory Integration Wayk Bastion supports Active Directory integration, such that you can leverage your existing user accounts instead of creating new ones. When enabled, a list of users from a specified group will be automatically synchronized in Wayk Bastion to become the primary user directory. Domain users are validated using LDAP authentication behind the scenes. To get started, you need the following: A dedicated LDAP reader account for synchronization Secure LDAP (LDAPS) configured in Active Directory LDAP reader account creation The Wayk Bastion server does not support integrated Windows authentication, such that you cannot run it under a Windows identity without giving credentials for a domain account explicitly. Active Directory contains a lot of information publicly available to anyone with a valid account, including the list of users, user groups, and group membership information. Since Wayk Bastion only needs to read this information and nothing more, the ideal is to create a restricted user account. Do not create a regular user account that is a member of one of the built-in groups, as it could potentially be used for more than just read from LDAP (network logon, local logon, etc). Create the LDAP Readers group in the global scope: Create the LDAP Reader user: Use a long generated password, and enable \"Password never expires\": Change the primary group of the ldap-reader account to the LDAP Readers group, then remove all other group memberships: $LdapReader = Get-ADUser \"ldap-reader\" $LdapReaders = Get-ADGroup \"LDAP Readers\" -Properties PrimaryGroupToken Add-ADGroupMember -Identity $LdapReaders.SID -Members $LdapReader.SID Set-ADUser $LdapReader -Replace @{ PrimaryGroupId = $LdapReaders.PrimaryGroupToken } Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership ldap-reader | ` Where-Object { $_.SID -ne $LdapReaders.SID } | ` Foreach-Object { Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity $_.SID -Members $LdapReader.SID } The ldap-reader account should now be only a member of the LDAP Readers group, excluding the built-in Domain Users group: Save the username for the account in UPN format (ldap-reader@ad.it-help.ninja) and the associated password for later. Configuring Secure LDAP (LDAPS) Wayk Bastion requires Secure LDAP (LDAPS) to be enabled in Active Directory to secure communication with the domain controller. While insecure LDAP traffic is common in a Windows domain, it is becoming increasingly difficult to support due to recent changes in LDAP channel binding and signing requirements . Requiring LDAPS is the safest and simplest option, with the side benefit of promoting Active Directory best practices. How to set up Secure LDAP for Active Directory is an excellent step-by-step guide showing the different ways Secure LDAP can be configured properly. The most common choice for the certificate authority is Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), because it is tightly integrated in Active Directory . However, it is also possible to use a certificate from a public certificate authority like Let's Encrypt. As a last resort, you can generate a self-signed certificate: this won't work for LDAPS traffic with domain-joined machines, but it be sufficient for Wayk Bastion integration with certificate validation disabled. You can always get started this way, then configure LDAPS properly later. Run the following code snippet to generate the self-signed certificate, import it into the NTDS certificate store, then tell the LDAP server to load: $DomainName = \"$Env:UserDnsDomain\".ToLower() $DnsName = $Env:ComputerName + \".\" + $DomainName $Certificate = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName $DnsName -CertStoreLocation \"cert:\\LocalMachine\\My\" $CertificateThumbprint = $Certificate.Thumbprint $LocalCertStore = 'HKLM:/Software/Microsoft/SystemCertificates/My/Certificates' $NtdsCertStore = 'HKLM:/Software/Microsoft/Cryptography/Services/NTDS/SystemCertificates/My/Certificates' if (-Not (Test-Path $NtdsCertStore)) { New-Item $NtdsCertStore -Force } Copy-Item -Path \"$LocalCertStore/$CertificateThumbprint\" -Destination $NtdsCertStore $dse = [adsi]'LDAP://localhost/rootDSE' [void]$dse.Properties['renewServerCertificate'].Add(1) $dse.CommitChanges() The domain controller should now respond to TLS handshakes on port 636: openssl s_client -connect IT-HELP-DC.ad.it-help.ninja:636 -showcerts If you test connectivity with ldp.exe, it will be difficult to tell if LDAPS is enabled: there is no difference between a connection error and a certificate validation error in the user interface, which is why it is easiest to test with the OpenSSL command-line tool. Wayk Account Provider In Settings , go to the Account Provider section, then select Active Directory as the LDAP server type: Fill the form with data similar to this: Server URL: ldaps://IT-HELP-DC.ad.it-help.ninja User Group: Domain Users Username: ldap-reader@ad.it-help.ninja Password: (ldap-reader password) Click the Test LDAP Configuration button to validate the configuration. If it worked, click the Save button at the top right of the screen. If you have a proper certificate authority in place, with a certificate that should validate automatically for the domain controller (don't forget the DNS name must match the one in the certificate!), then you can go one step further and enable certificate validation: For private certificate authorities, you need to import the certificate authority certificate in PEM format into the Trusted Root CA field for automatic validation to work. If validation still fails, make sure that the name in the certificate matches the hostname used in the Server URL field. If you don't have DNS properly configured from the machine where Wayk Bastion is hosted, you can always manually specify the IP address of the domain controller in the Server IP field while using the correct hostname in the Server URL field. However, some LDAPS certificates encode the IP address, causing validation issues when this trick is used. You can now go in Users , then All Users , and you should now see the list of users synchronized from Active Directory: The users synchronized in Wayk Bastion are all members of the user group previously configured. While the built-in Domain Users group may be sufficient, it unfortunately tends to contain a few undesirable accounts (krbtgt, sshd, etc). To avoid this issue, create a dedicated \"Wayk Users\" group in Active Directory and add all the user groups and users in it that should be synchronized in Wayk Bastion. It should now be possible to create new user groups from this flat list of users. There is currently no advanced synchronization of user groups from Active Directory with user groups in Wayk Bastion. Wayk User Login To login with one of the Active Directory users, enter the username in UPN format (dford@ad.it-help.ninja) and the same password normally used for Windows: If login fails, make sure you that the Active Directory users have been added to user groups in Wayk Bastion with sufficient permissions to access the web interface."

    "keywords": "Database Management Aside from the Wayk Bastion configuration files, all Wayk Bastion data is stored inside a MongoDB database . If you do not specify a database, a simple MongoDB container will be launched with a docker volume attached to it. While this is fine for a lot of use cases, using a single MongoDB container instance is not suitable for high availability scenarios. Note If you need help installing and configuring a MongoDB server, use this guide instead . External Database To point Wayk Bastion to an existing MongoDB server, you need to configure a database connection string, and set MongoDB as external to avoid launching a MongoDB container instance: Set-WaykBastionConfig -MongoExternal $true -MongoUrl 'mongodb://mongo-server:27017' Database Backup MongoDB database backups can be done using the mongodump command-line tool . For simplicity, the Backup-WaykBastionData command can be used to streamline the process: Backup-WaykBastionData -BackupPath .\\den-backup.tgz -Verbose The Backup-WaykBastionData is only usable with a non-external MongoDB database. You can add the -Verbose parameter to show the docker commands used to call mongodump inside a container for reference. Database Restore A MongoDB database can be restored from a backup using the mongorestore command-line tool . For obvious reasons, you should be careful about restoring a database, as the operation will overwrite the current data and replace it with the one from the backup. Just like Backup-WaykBastionData , Restore-WaykBastionData should only be used with a non-external MongoDB database. A proper restore involves stopping Wayk Bastion, restoring data from the backup file, then restarting Wayk Bastion.

This can be useful for safe experimentation in a temporary database without touching the \"good\" one. If you want to revert back to the original database, simply change the docker volume again: PS > Stop-WaykBastion PS > Set-WaykBastionConfig -MongoVolume 'den-mongodata' PS > Start-WaykBastion Where den-mongodata is the default docker volume name. Deleting database If you want to start fresh and delete the MongoDB database entirely (use with caution!), here are the steps: PS > Stop-WaykBastion PS > docker rm den-mongo PS > docker volume rm den-mongodata The above commands stop all containers, delete the den-mongo container currently associated with the den-mongodata volume, and then proceed to delete the docker volume containing the MongoDB database files."

    "title": "Deployment Automation | docs.devolutions.net",
    "keywords": "Deployment Automation Once you have a Wayk Bastion server ready, the next step is to find a way to automate the process of installing, registering and configuring Wayk Agent on all of the machines you need to manage. This process is important in order to reduce the total number of manual operations that one needs to perform, especially if you have a large number of machines. Installation Wayk Agent should be installed using the .msi installer on Windows, or the .pkg installer on macOS. You cannot use the standalone executable for unattended access. As such, Wayk is not an agentless product because you need to install Wayk Agent. If you already have a tool that can push the installer on your machines and install it this way, you can download the packages from our CDN and do the installation this way. If you do not have a way of pushing the installer on the remote machines but can get them to execute scripts, such as logon scripts pushed through GPO in a Windows domain, we recommend automating the downloading of the package from our CDN. The downloading and installing of the Wayk Agent package is already automated in our WaykAgent PowerShell module available on PSGallery . This cmdlet is compatible with PowerShell 7 (and Windows PowerShell 5.1) and works on all operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). If you would rather make your own script to do the same thing without using the cmdlet, simply use the PowerShell code available on GitHub as reference to roll your own. Enrollment The enrollment token is used to authorize machines to join your Wayk Bastion and automatically register for unattended access. This token is meant to be easily embedded within scripts, such that all you need is to run a command to get Wayk Agent to register with a specific Wayk Bastion initially. To create a new enrollment token, go in \"Servers → Machine Registration\", then click the \"Generate\". You can set a validity period for the token, or you can also disable token expiration by setting it to Never . If you want to keep using a token after it has expired, there is always the possibility of renewing it. To simplify group management, you can also select in which group machines using this token will be put. If you want to automatically enroll different machines in different groups, simply create more than one token and use them appropriately. Click \"Generate\" to create the enrollment token with the desired options. You should now see the enrollment token in the list. For the moment, the only information which you need is the token id (f762156f-9470-4dcc-9ba3-157437e465ce), which can be easily embedded in an automation script. Enrollment Using Token Id After installing Wayk Agent on a machine, the wayk-now command-line becomes available for post-installation automation. To automatically enroll Wayk Agent to your private Wayk Bastion, call the wayk-now enroll command with the --token-id and --den-url parameters: wayk-now enroll --token-id f762156f-9470-4dcc-9ba3-157437e465ce --den-url https://den.contoso.com If the command is successful, Wayk Agent will be configured to point to your Wayk Bastion, and will be automatically registered for unattended access. It should now be visible in the list of registered machines in Wayk Bastion: It's also possible to pass the enrollment information directly to the Windows .msi at install time. See Agent Configuration . Enrollment Using Token Data While the token id is relatively short and easy to embed into a script, it has one disadvantage: it doesn’t contain information about the Wayk Bastion it belongs to. This is why the --den-url parameter is required when using the token id for automated enrollment. The alternative is to extract and use the full token data, such that the only thing you need is the token. However, the token data is usually much longer and usually needs to be embedded in a file to be passed to Wayk Agent. To extract the enrollment token data, click on the vertical ellipsis (⋮) button besides the enrollment token, and select \"View full token\": The full token data will be presented for you to copy to the clipboard. This long string is a valid JSON Web Token (JWT), and its contents can be inspected by pasting it in the jwt.io debugger tool . For automated enrollment, save this token to a file on disk (such as C:\\token.txt ) and then use the wayk-now enroll command: wayk-now enroll --token-file C:\\token.txt Alternatively, you can also pass the full enrollment token data at the command-line, even if it is quite long: wayk-now enroll --token-data eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2Rlbi5idXp6d29yZC5tYXJrZXRpbmciLCJqdGkiOiJmNzYyMTU2Zi05NDcwLTRkY2MtOWJhMy0xNTc0MzdlNDY1Y2UiLCJpYXQiOjE1OTcwODI3NjMsImV4cCI6MTU5OTY3NDc2M30.hWaKDCHXuCHd6dXNwkvdCVKSY3eZXN7qWKKPkeSFdT4NkhT8H-p_GNXxpXuE-OTfOFislg9F1eacV5p86ef3qukgWp_qw_LJ6O8kBcq1AQccSFM7nkyB5yvXnAFbvuOJyUnGxmGG0eO9b3ihA3RVZdQFaQrn7uDyQSAnPssq1M0tli9ywcXki__IzAFI7ZXDPZPKwEw_xedADNSNfL7Gb_pnFnTsyuSOLynq7T8TPdR0G5YSG6palnRjWKPlZeEfYhYq6qu_zDSDLDLgfLFxjSxVHUGd62cSC3r1ne5Viu7GZKZIQJR2T1ljWPBfttqYjrHZMTe6JiU3-E7VUVYLVQ However, we recommend using a file to pass the enrollment token data whenever possible, as simple copy/paste errors are easy to make with large strings like this. Configuration Once Wayk Agent is installed and registered with Wayk Bastion, you may want to change configuration settings. This can be done through the wayk-now config command. These commands can be appended to your custom deployment script that installs the package, performs automated enrollment and finishes by modifying the configuration. See Agent Configuration . Deployment PowerShell Module The Wayk Agent can be installed and configured using the WaykAgent PowerShell module, making it easy to write a custom script for deployment automation. Install-Module -Name WaykAgent -Scope AllUsers -Force Import-Module -Name WaykAgent Install Wayk Agent quietly: Install-WaykAgent -Quiet Register Wayk Agent with Wayk Bastion: Register-WaykAgent ` -DenUrl \"https://bastion.ad.it-help.ninja\" ` -TokenId \"1be20ccc-7714-4bb7-b88a-a8a6a873f653\" You can find additional commands exposed by the WaykAgent PowerShell module using the Get-Command -Module WaykAgent . Custom Executable The Wayk Agent can be deployed using a one-click custom executable preconfigured to install, configure and register Wayk Agent with Wayk Bastion. Install the WaykCustomExecutable PowerShell module: Install-Module -Name WaykCustomExecutable -Scope AllUsers Import-Module -Name WaykCustomExecutable Install the 7-zip command-line tool manually or using chocolatey ( choco install 7zip -y ). Make sure that the '7z' executable can be found in the system PATH: PS > where.exe 7z C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\bin\\7z.exe The custom executable requires the following parameters: DenUrl: Wayk Bastion server URL (https) TokenId: Machine registration token id The BrandingFile parameter is optional, but if you used the white-label editor, the resulting branding.zip file can be exported using the \"save\" button: Choose a directory in which to put all the files, here I used \"C:\\shared\" and made it a network share for easy distribution on the local network. Run the following command to generate your first custom executable: New-WaykCustomExecutable ` -DenUrl \"https://bastion.ad.it-help.ninja\" ` -TokenId \"1be20ccc-7714-4bb7-b88a-a8a6a873f653\" ` -BrandingFile \".\\branding.zip\" ` -DestinationPath \".\" ` -DestinationName \"ItHelpAgent\" ` -Architecture \"x64\" ` -EmbedMsi $true The custom executable generation process and resulting files should look like this: The new \"ItHelpAgent.exe\" custom executable is now ready to be deployed to machines for a one-click installation."

    "title": "Docker Installation | docs.devolutions.net",
    "keywords": "Docker Installation Wayk Bastion is a product composed of multiple services shipped as Docker containers for Windows and Linux, which is why you need a working Docker environment to get started. We recommend choosing one of the two following combinations: Windows Server 2019 + Windows Containers Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS + Linux Containers Other versions of Windows may work, but we do not support them officially. We recommend Ubuntu Linux because it is was we use, but other Linux distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) should work the same. Windows When in Rome, do as the Romans do: use Windows containers on Windows. Real Windows containers are best supported in Windows Server 2019, which is why we make it a requirement for Windows. Other versions of Windows have important Docker limitations and are therefore not officially supported. Warning Many antivirus software vendors do not provide suitable Docker for Windows exclusions by default, breaking the Docker engine, severely degrading container performance, and even corrupting database files. Windows Server 2019 The official way of running Wayk Bastion on Windows Server is to use the built-in support for Windows containers instead of installing Docker Desktop for Windows and running Linux containers. If you intend to run Wayk Bastion inside a virtual machine, using Windows Server and Windows containers is the recommended approach because it does not require Docker Desktop for Windows and a Hyper-V virtual machine. Install or update NuGet and PowerShellGet: $ Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Force $ Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force Check if the Windows Server Containers feature is installed, then install it: $ Get-WindowsFeature | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'Containers' } $ Install-WindowsFeature -Name Containers -Restart Install the Microsoft Docker provider: $ Install-Module -Name DockerMsftProvider -Force $ Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -Force Start the docker service if it is not currently running: $ Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'docker' } $ Start-Service -Name docker Windows 10 On Windows 10, the recommended option is to use Docker Desktop for Windows . This version of Docker requires Hyper-V for Linux container support, making it suitable for testing on a physical machine, but not so much for a virtual machine because of limited support of Docker Desktop for Windows in virtualized environments. If you want to try Wayk Bastion inside a virtual machine, use Windows Server 2019 instead with Windows containers. One important thing to know about Docker for Windows is that you need to switch to Windows containers instead of the default (Linux containers). Trying to launch Windows containers when Linux containers are enabled will result in a \"no matching manifest for windows/amd64\" error. For bind mount support with Linux containers on Windows, you need to go in the Docker settings and select the required drives from the \"Shared Drives\" section . Linux On Linux, follow one of the distribution-specific getting started guides , then do not forget to add your user to the docker group after installation. To confirm that Docker is up and running, use the docker run hello-world command. If you don’t see the \"Hello from Docker!\" message, something is wrong with your Docker installation. macOS On macOS, follow the official Docker Desktop getting started guide . While macOS is not an officially supported platform for Wayk Bastion, it is suitable for testing. Antivirus Warning Many antivirus software vendors do not provide suitable Docker for Windows exclusions by default, breaking the Docker engine, severely degrading container performance, and even corrupting database files. Okay, the above warning may come off as scary, but it is not as bad as it sounds. Containers are by nature running isolated from the host, something much better than traditional software that runs directly on the host. File Scan Exclusion Following the recommendation made by Docker , add %ProgramData%\\Docker to the list of file scan exclusions. This will prevent your antivirus from scanning container images and container volumes. These are large files that the antivirus should not lock, modify or delete in any case anyway. Because the antivirus locks the files as it scans them, Docker is much slower at launching the containers that are composed of a layered file system (very large for Windows containers). As for database files, similar exclusions are commonly required when running database software on the host, so this is just the equivalent for containers. Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) The \"Application and Device Control (ADC) component of Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) is known to break the Docker engine and should be removed entirely. Additional exclusions are also required and documented here . Finally, you can refer to the following blog post for further guidance. Sophos Endpoint Protection Sophos Endpoint Protection should work fine as long as %ProgramData%\\Docker is added to the file scan exclusion list. Surprisingly, Sophos does not seem to document a recommended Docker for Windows exclusion procedure. Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) We've had one instance where Cisco AMP broke Docker for a customer, and the problem went away after disabling it entirely. If you use Cisco AMP and figure out how to make it work with Docker, please let us know, as we couldn't find a clear answer on the Cisco website. Other Antivirus Software If you don't see instructions specific to your antivirus software and run into issues, try disabling it temporarily, and then search for exclusion recommendations from your antivirus vendor. It is hard to test for all antivirus software out there, so we welcome contributions to keep the list up to date. Virtual Machine VMWare Tools The VMware tools versions 11.0.1 to 11.0.5 have a known issue that causes Docker to shutdown at random intervals between 15 and 30 minutes. This issue was resolved in the VMware tools version 11.0.6 , so it is very important to update if you encounter any issues and use VMware. The most common symptom will be a problems showing up in the logs of the MongoDB container after an abnormal restart."

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide (ACME/letsencrypt) This getting started shows how to obtain free TLS certificates from letsencrypt using Posh-ACME and the Azure DNS plugin . Since letsencrypt certificates are valid only for 90 days, the process should be automated, but we will cover a simple manual procedure first. If you have never used letsencrypt before, it is a good way to get started. Prerequisites For this getting started guide, we will be using: A domain name (buzzword.marketing) An Azure DNS zone for our domain The Azure and Posh-ACME PowerShell modules Step 1: Obtain a domain If you don’t have a domain available for testing, you can buy one from your favorite registrar. In our case, we have bought the \"buzzword.marketing\" domain from namecheap . Before going further, make sure you have access to the account used to configure DNS servers for the domain name you intend to use. Step 2: Create Azure DNS zone Refer to the following Microsoft articles to create an Azure DNS zone: Quickstart: Create an Azure DNS zone and record using the Azure portal Tutorial: Host your domain in Azure DNS First, create an Azure DNS zone, and then obtain the list of the Microsoft name servers associated with it. These are the custom DNS servers that need to be configured with your domain registrar. From the above screenshot, the custom name servers are: ns1-09.azure-dns.com ns2-09.azure-dns.net ns3-09.azure-dns.org ns4-09.azure-dns.info These custom name servers need to be configured with your domain registrar in order to manage the domain from the Azure DNS zone. The procedure is different for each registrar, but here is procedure for using custom DNS servers with namecheap . Once your domain is configured to be managed through the Azure DNS zone, you no longer need access to the registrar account aside from renewing your domain registration. All DNS records can be now be managed from Azure, which is perfect for performing the ACME DNS challenge required to prove ownership of a given domain with letsencrypt. Step 3: Request a certificate This is where it can get tricky if you wish to automate things correctly, but there exists a rather a quick path to requesting certificates without too much trouble. Open a PowerShell prompt, then install and import the Az and Posh-ACME PowerShell modules: > Install-Module -Name Az > Install-Module -Name Posh-ACME > Import-Module Az > Import-Module Posh-ACME Az is the Azure PowerShell module , and Posh-ACME is a PowerShell module that supports the ACME protocol used by letsencrypt along with a rich set of plugins for integrating with DNS providers. In our case, we will be using the Azure DNS plugin because our domain is managed with an Azure DNS zone. Here is the plan: we will login to the Azure Portal using the Azure PowerShell module, grab the access token from the Az context and pass it to Posh-ACME such that it can proceed with the ACME DNS challenge. Since the access token expires every two minutes, you may have to login again if you get an expired token error. However, this procedure skips the trouble of configuring a separate account suitable for automation. From the PowerShell prompt, call Connect-AzAccount . If you have more than one subscriptions, you should specify which one you wish to connect to, otherwise you will get the default subscription associated with your account: PS /home/mamoreau> Connect-AzAccount -Subscription 'wayk staging' Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environment ------- ---------------- -------- ----------- mamoreau@devolutions.net Wayk Staging cf76f217-2059-4091-bb00-878429f5cc64 AzureCloud Follow the instructions given by the Connect-AzAccount command. You can now go back to your PowerShell prompt and do everything that can be done through the Azure Portal, but with PowerShell instead! Copy and paste the following code snippet to grab the access token and prepare the parameters to be passed to the Azure DNS plugin: $az = Get-AzContext; $token = Get-AzAccessToken $AzParams = @{ AZSubscriptionId=$az.Subscription.Id; AZAccessToken=$token.Token; } Set the $CommonName variable to the domain for which you wish to request a certificate. In our code, we will be requesting a certificate for test.buzzword.marketing : $CommonName = \"test.buzzword.marketing\" If this is the first time using letsencrypt, you will have to accept the terms of use. Run the following command once: New-PACertificate $CommonName -AcceptTOS -Contact admin@example.com The contact email address is optional, and is used to receive expiration notifications. Proceed immediately to requesting your certificate: $Certificate = New-PACertificate $CommonName -DnsPlugin Azure -PluginArgs $AzParams $CertPath = Split-Path -Path $Certificate.PfxFile -Parent If all went well, the New-PACertificate command should take about a minute to complete, with a \"Waiting for DNS to propagate\" message. If you get an error saying that the access token is expired, login again and run the token-grabbing code snippet again. The $CertPath variable now point to the local directory where all the certificate files produced by Posh-ACME are stored. The default password (when none has been specified) is poshacme . The file of interest we will be using is fullchain.pfx because it contains both the full chain and the private key, but the certificate is also available in .pem and .key format. That’s it, you now have a valid TLS certificate emitted by letsencrypt that you can use for testing! You can learn about more advanced options available from the Posh-ACME tutorial ."

    "title": "Getting Started Guide (Argo Tunnel) | docs.devolutions.net",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide (Argo Tunnel) This getting started guide provides instructions for setting up a one-time Wayk Bastion demo environment using a free Cloudflare Argo tunnel for external access. Step 1: Launch Wayk Bastion for localhost access only Open a PowerShell terminal and load the WaykBastion module. Create a new directory for your Wayk Bastion configuration files and move into it. Create a new configuration using your external URL and \"windjammer.local\" as the realm, then start Wayk Bastion: $ Import-Module WaykBastion $ mkdir ~/bastion-test $ cd ~/bastion-test $ New-WaykBastionConfig -Realm windjammer.local -ExternalUrl http://localhost:4000 $ Start-WaykBastion The realm is a domain name for your Wayk Bastion, very similar to a Windows Active Directory domain name, but it does not need to be a valid DNS domain name. In this case, we use windjammer.local for a fictional company called \"Windjammer\". Do not open http://localhost:4000 in a browser yet. We will access it through the Argo tunnel instead. We just need Wayk Bastion to be running first for the Argo tunnel to be opened. Leave this terminal open: we will come back to it later. Step 2: Create free Argo tunnel for external access Download the cloudflared executable for your platform to a known path Open a new terminal and move to the directory where the cloudflared executable is located. Then, confirm that the tool can be found at command-line: $ cloudflared --version cloudflared version 2019.12.0 (built 2019-12-19-2246 UTC) Create a free Argo tunnel pointing to \"http://localhost:4000\" and wait for it to become ready: $ cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:4000 Search within the terminal output for your trycloudflare.com generated URL. It should look like this: INFO[0002] +--------------------------------------------------------+ connectionID=0 INFO[0002] | Your free tunnel has started! Visit it: | connectionID=0 INFO[0002] | https://wayk-bastion-demo-test.trycloudflare.com | connectionID=0 INFO[0002] +--------------------------------------------------------+ connectionID=0 This terminal needs to remain open to keep the Argo tunnel active. The free tunnel URL changes every time and is composed of 4 random words, but this is fine as we are using this for a one-time Wayk Bastion demo environment. You will get a different URL every time you create a free Argo tunnel, unless you register for the paid service . For the purpose of this guide, the external URL is \"https://wayk-bastion-demo-test.trycloudflare.com\", but you will need to replace it with the one you obtained when following these instructions. Step 3: Launch Wayk Bastion using the Argo tunnel external URL Now that we have launched the Argo tunnel, HTTP requests to \"https://wayk-bastion-demo-test.trycloudflare.com\" will be automatically redirected to \"http://localhost:4000\", with SSL/TLS certificates automatically handled by Cloudflare. Go back to the PowerShell terminal where Wayk Bastion was started. Stop Wayk Bastion, modify the external URL and start Wayk Bastion again. $ Stop-WaykBastion $ Set-WaykBastionConfig -ExternalUrl https://wayk-bastion-demo-test.trycloudflare.com $ Start-WaykBastion That’s it! You should now be able to open the external URL in a browser and see a login page. Step 4: Complete initial configuration from Wayk Bastion Web UI Now that Wayk Bastion is running and available externally through an Argo tunnel, you can proceed to creating a first admin user. Open your external URL (\"https://wayk-bastion-demo-test.trycloudflare.com\") in a browser. In a fresh installation, you can log in using the \"wayk-admin\" username and \"wayk-admin\" password, after which you will be asked to create your first admin user. For the purpose of this guide, we will create the user \"admin\" with the password \"admin123!\". All passwords for test purposes will be the same as the username with \"123!\" appended to it. If you do not have a fresh database and wish to reset it, you can stop the Wayk Bastion, run \"docker rm den-mongo\" and \"den volume rm den-mongodata\" and start the Wayk Bastion. Once logged in, click Users from the left navigation menu: In the top right corner, click \"Add\" to create a user called \"David Ford\" with username \"dford\" and password \"dford123!\": In the top right corner, click \"Add\" to create a user called \"Robert Young\" with username \"ryoung\" and password \"ryoung123!\": Your list of users should now look like this: Click on the vertical ellipsis (⋮) button to the right of user \"dford\" to show a contextual action menu, then click \"Manage role\". From the list of available roles, select \"Machine contributor\" then click the + sign to add the role to the current user. This role is required to register new unattended machines in Wayk Bastion, so you may want to perform the same operation for user \"ryoung\". In a regular deployment, we would need to add a valid Wayk Bastion Client Access License (CAL) in Wayk Bastion and assign it to technicians using Wayk Client. However, if you deploy Wayk Bastion using a free cloudflare Argo tunnel (limited to *.trycloudflare.com URLs), a special demo mode is activated where Wayk Bastion simulates having a site license configured. This means you can follow this guide without requesting a Wayk Bastion trial. You are now ready to try connecting Wayk Client to your Wayk Bastion with your test users. Step 5: Configure a Windows machine for unattended access For the purpose of this guide, this machine will be called \"DFORD-PC\". On a Windows machine, install Wayk Agent using the .msi installer. Once installed, launch Wayk Agent, then click File → Options from the menu of the main window. Click \"Unlock\" at the bottom left of the Options window to elevate permissions and allow modifications to settings affecting the Wayk Agent unattended service. In the \"Connectivity\" section, change the \"Wayk Bastion Server Url\" value to your Wayk Bastion external URL ( https://wayk-bastion-demo-test.trycloudflare.com ) and click OK to apply the changes. The Wayk Agent main window status bar should show a red circle for a few seconds, then it should go back to green when it has connected to the new Wayk Bastion. Go back to the \"Connectivity\" section of the Options window and unlock it again. Under \"Wayk Bastion User\", you should now see a \"Log in\" link. Click \"Log in\" to open the Wayk Bastion login page with the default system browser. Enter \"dford\" as the username and \"dford123!\" as the password, then click Continue. You should now see a login success page: Close the browser and come back to the Wayk Agent Options window. It should now show the user \"dford\" as logged in to Wayk Bastion: Last but not least, click \"Register\" to register the machine for unattended access. To verify that the machine was correctly registered, go back to the Wayk Bastion Web UI and go in the \"Machines\" section. Your machine should now be listed: Step 6: Connect to the Windows machine using a Wayk Client On another machine, install Wayk Client, and follow the instructions of the previous step for the Wayk Bastion configuration, with the exception of the unattended machine registration which is not required. When logging in, use \"ryoung\" as the username and \"ryoung123!\" as the password. For the purpose of this guide, this machine will be called \"RYOUNG-PC\". At this point, you should be able to see both machines connected to the Wayk Bastion in the \"Connections\" section: Each machine is shown as connected twice, because the unattended service and the Wayk Client make separate connections to the Wayk Bastion. From the connection list, we can see that the target ID of \"DFORD-PC\" is \"430515\". This target ID is also shown in the Wayk Client main window on DFORD-PC in the \"Source ID\" field. On RYOUNG-PC, launch Wayk Client, type \"430515\" in the \"Target ID\" field and click \"Connect\": At the login prompt, select \"Secure Remote Delegation (SRD)\" and enter a valid system username + password for the target machine (\"DFORD-PC\"). Once connected, you should now be able to see your active session in the \"Sessions\" section of the Wayk Bastion Web UI: This list contains both current and past sessions for monitoring and auditing purposes."

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide (Azure VM) This getting started guide provides instructions for setting up Wayk Bastion on a Windows Server 2019 Core + Containers virtual machine instance in Azure. This guide can also be followed for installation on a regular Windows Server 2019 Core virtual machine outside of Azure with minimal adjustments. We will be deploying Wayk Bastion on an Azure VM for a fictional company called BuzzWord Marketing, with a real domain name (den.buzzword.marketing). Step 1: Create Azure VM In the Azure Marketplace, find the \"Windows Server\" virtual machine resource, select \"Windows Server 2019 Datacenter Server Core with Containers\" then click \"Create\": Select a workload environment based on your needs, the click \"Continue to create a VM\". For the purpose of this guide, I selected the recommended defaults for development and testing. Create a resource group for the VM (BuzzWordMarketing) and name the resource BuzzWordServer. Fill the form for the Administrator account, we will be using it to access the virtual machine with RDP. Last but not least, select all inbound ports (HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22), RDP(3389)). Click \"Next: Disks\" to continue. Keep the default disk configuration, then click \"Next: Networking\". Keep the default networking configuration, then click \"Next: Management\". To control costs on a test virtual machine, disable boot diagnostics and enable auto-shutdown. Skip the \"Advanced\" and \"Tags\" sections to go to the final \"Review + Create\" section. Review the virtual machine configuration, then click \"Create\". Wait for a few minutes until the virtual machine creation is completed. Once completed, click on the virtual machine resource. Click on the \"Connect\" button in the menu bar on top of the screen to show connection options. Copy the virtual machine IP address (40.121.21.221) to the clipboard and keep it for later. Download the .rdp file and open it with an RDP client. Use the previously configured administrator account to connect to the virtual machine. If all worked well, you should see a Windows command prompt inside an empty desktop, a good sign that you’ve successfully connected to a Windows Server core virtual machine that doesn’t have Desktop Experience installed. Type \"start powershell\" to open a blue PowerShell prompt instead of the default black Windows command prompt. Step 2: Configure DNS Now that the virtual machine is up and running, we will create a DNS record pointing to it. For this guide, we bought the domain buzzword.marketing from namecheap , created a corresponding Azure DNS zone , then configured namecheap with custom DNS name servers from Azure . It is recommended to expose Wayk Bastion on a \"den\" subdomain, so we will create a DNS A record with \"den\" as the name and our public IP address (40.121.21.221) as value. Click OK, then wait for the DNS configuration to propagate, until den.buzzword.marketing can be resolved. Step 3: Launch Wayk Bastion Go back to the RDP client connected to the Azure VM and the PowerShell prompt. Make sure that the docker service is running: > Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'docker' } > Start-Service -Name docker Install the WaykBastion module: > Install-Module -Name WaykBastion -Force Import the WaykBastion module: > Import-Module -Name WaykBastion Create a new Wayk Bastion configuration and then import a valid TLS certificate. For testing, I have obtained a free certificate from letsencrypt using Posh-ACME and the Azure DNS plugin . > New-WaykBastionConfig -Realm buzzword.marketing -ExternalUrl 'https://den.buzzword.marketing' -ListenerUrl 'https://localhost:443' > Import-WaykDenCertificate -CertificateFile .\\fullchain.pfx -Password 'poshacme' Alternatively, you can skip the TLS certificate configuration and expose Wayk Bastion in HTTP (never do this in production): > New-WaykBastionConfig -Realm buzzword.marketing -ExternalUrl 'http://den.buzzword.marketing' -ListenerUrl 'http://localhost:80' Finally, start Wayk Bastion: > Start-WaykBastion -Verbose The first launch will pull all docker images based on Windows Server Core, which can take a while because of their large size. Once started, you should be able to open https://den.buzzword.marketing in your browser. From there, you can follow the getting started guide (Argo tunnel) starting from Step 4: Complete initial configuration from Wayk Bastion Web UI."

    "title": "IIS Deployment | docs.devolutions.net",
    "keywords": "IIS Deployment Deploying Wayk Bastion behind IIS is possible with the URL Rewrite and Application Request Routing (ARR) modules. IIS is not necessarily the recommended deployment option for Wayk Bastion ( traefik , nginx and haproxy are worthy alternatives). However, if you are comfortable with IIS or if you need it to deploy additional applications that require IIS within the same server, then it should be a good choice. IIS Feature Installation Open a PowerShell prompt and install the base IIS features required (IIS server + WebSocket support + management tools) $Features = @( 'Web-Server', 'Web-WebSockets', 'Web-Mgmt-Tools') foreach ($Feature in $Features) { Install-WindowsFeature -Name $Feature } You can install additional features, but the most important not to forget is the WebSocket protocol support: As for the IIS graphical management tools, they are recommended but not required, and they are absent from Windows Server Core. IIS Module Installation The two IIS modules we need (URL Rewrite and Application Request Routing) are not available as IIS features, and need to be installed using the Web Platform Installer . Once you have the Web Platform Installer, install (in order) the URL Rewrite and the Application Request Routing modules: IIS URL Rewrite Module IIS Application Request Routing Module Alternatively, you can install the modules using chocolatey : choco install urlrewrite -y choco install iis-arr -y However, the IIS URL Rewrite and Application Request Routing (ARR) modules are difficult to install automatically, so results may vary. The GUI installation is the most guaranteed to work. IIS Global Configuration By default, IIS does not preserve the HTTP Host header when proxying requests, which breaks Wayk Bastion. The preserveHostHeader setting in the system.webServer/proxy section of the configuration needs to be set to true : Alternatively, the same modification can be done at the command line: %windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe set config -section:system.webServer/proxy -preserveHostHeader:true /commit:apphost Next, set the useOriginalURLEncoding setting in the system.WebServer/rewrite/globalRules section to false : The same modification can also be done at the command line: %windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe set config -section:system.WebServer/rewrite/globalRules -useOriginalURLEncoding:false /commit:apphost This change is necessary to obtain an unmodified UNENCODED_URL variable in URL rewrite rules . IIS Site Configuration In IIS manager, right-click \"Sites\" and select \"Add Website..\" In the \"Add Website\" dialog, enter a site name, physical path and host name. Make sure that the host name you choose is the final one you expect to use with https and matches your certificate name. As for the physical path on disk, it is not going to be used, but IIS requires you to have one. I have created \"C:\\inetpub\\bastion\", but you can use any path you want. Click OK to create the new website, then select it from the list of sites on the left. With the correct site selected on the left, find the \"URL Rewrite\" feature and double-click to open it: Under \"Actions\" at the top right, click \"Add Rule(s)…\". In the \"Add Rule(s)\" dialog, select \"Reverse Proxy\" and then click OK. While creating the new reverse proxy rule, you will likely be asked to enable proxy functionality (Application Request Routing). Click OK to enable it: Upon creation of the first reverse proxy rule, you will also be prompted for the destination server. Just enter 'localhost' for now and click OK: You should now see a single rule called \"ReverseProxyInboundRule1\" in the list. Double-click on it to open the \"Edit Inbound Rule\" view. In the \"Match URL\" section, leave the \"(.*)\" default pattern value. Go to the \"Conditions\" section and then click \"Add…\" to create a new condition: In the Action section, select the \"Rewrite\" action type, and enter \"http://localhost:4000/{C:1}\" in the Rewrite URL field. Make sure to uncheck \"Append query string\" as the query string is already containing within '{C:1}' capture group (UNENCODED_URL variable). The final result should look like this: This URL rewrite rule will now forward incoming traffic to http://localhost:4000 with proper handling of the URL query parameter encoding. If you host Wayk Bastion on a different host and port, simply change the destination URL. Here is the resulting web.config file containing the URL rewrite rule for reference: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <configuration> <system.webServer> <rewrite> <rules> <clear /> <rule name=\"ReverseProxyInboundRule1\" patternSyntax=\"ECMAScript\" stopProcessing=\"true\"> <match url=\"(.*)\" /> <conditions logicalGrouping=\"MatchAll\" trackAllCaptures=\"false\"> <add input=\"{UNENCODED_URL}\" pattern=\"/(.*)\" /> </conditions> <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"http://localhost:4000/{C:1}\" appendQueryString=\"false\" logRewrittenUrl=\"true\" /> </rule> </rules> </rewrite> </system.webServer> </configuration> IIS Certificate Configuration While obtaining a proper server certificate is outside of the scope of this guide, you still need to import it in IIS before configuring an HTTPS site binding for your site. Valid certificates from letsencrypt can be obtained using win-acme and following instructions from this blog post . Alternatively, we recommend giving Posh-ACME a try. To import your certificate, locate the \"Server Certificates\" feature and double-click on it to open it: At the top right, under \"Actions\", click \"Import…\". In the \"Import Certificate\" dialog, select your certificate in .pfx file, enter the password and then click OK. You can now create a new HTTPS site binding. Under \"Sites\", right-click your site and then select \"Edit Bindings…\": In the \"Site Bindings\" dialog, click \"Add…\": Select \"https\" as the binding type, and enter your IIS site host name. Check \"Require Server Name Indication\" and \"Disable HTTP/2\". Click \"Select…\", then select the server certificate that was previously imported. Click OK to create the new site binding. Last but not least, click on the \"SSL Settings\" feature of your site and make sure that \"Require SSL\" is unchecked, and that \"Client certificates\" is set to \"Ignore\": Those SSL settings are sometimes confused with the HTTPS server certificate configuration. If you enable it by mistake, you may see a certificate prompt when loading the website in the browser, as it is meant to enforce client certificate authentication. That’s it! Your IIS site is now ready. Review your Wayk Bastion configuration ListenerUrl and ExternalUrl parameters to make sure they correspond to your current configuration: Set-WaykBastionConfig -ListenerUrl 'http://localhost:4000' -ExternalUrl 'https://bastion.now-it.works' Then start Wayk Bastion, and you should now be able to access it through your IIS site. If it doesn’t work the first time, try running iisreset once to force the configuration changes made earlier."

    "keywords": "Wayk Bastion Overview Warning We are in the process of rebranding Wayk Den to Wayk Bastion, so some of the documentation may be outdated. If you are upgrading from Wayk Den to Wayk Bastion, please follow the steps from the migration guide . WaykBastion is a PowerShell module for Wayk Bastion, the centralized server for Devolutions Wayk . For assistance or feature requests, please use the Wayk forums or open a ticket on this github project. Make sure you have all software prerequisites then read one of our getting started guides: getting started guide (Argo tunnel) getting started guide (Azure VM) . getting started guide (ACME/letsencrypt) . Devolutions Gateway getting started guide . IIS deployment guide . Once you have been familiarized with Wayk Bastion, come back to this page for more details on specific aspects of the software. Installation Docker Docker Installation PowerShell PowerShell Installation PowerShell module A powershell module is available to configure and manage the Wayk Bastion server. It is available on PSGallery or it could be built directly from source code . We recommend to install the latest version available on PSGallery, but if needed, a section describe how to build it if you need it. The Wayk Bastion PowerShell module is available on PSGallery . Install-Module -Name WaykBastion -Scope AllUsers Import-Module WaykBastion You can then list all commands exported from the WaykBastion module: Get-Command -Module WaykBastion When a new version comes out, you can update the cmdlet and restart Wayk Bastion to upgrade. The updated cmdlet will point to newer versions of the docker containers used in Wayk Bastion, so upgrading is a simple matter of restarting Wayk Bastion: Update-Module -Name WaykBastion Import-Module WaykBastion Restart-WaykBastion You can also list all Powershell module versions installed: Get-Module WaykBastion -ListAvailable -All You could see some modules installed in Program Files folder and others installed in Users folder depending if you used a Powershell prompt with elevated permissions (run as Administrator) or not to install the module. We should always use a prompt with elevated privileges to install or update Wayk Bastion Powershell module to install all versions in Program Files folder. If it is not the case, you can uninstall all versions and reinstall with the command above. To uninstall all versions: Uninstall-Module -Name WaykBastion -AllVersion Deployment Before jumping in to the configuration, let’s review the different deployment options. Layer 4 deployment: Expose services externally through TCP (layer 4) and handle HTTPS inside Wayk Bastion. Layer 7 deployment: Expose services externally through a layer 7 reverse proxy (HTTPS) that offloads TLS from Wayk Bastion. Wayk Bastion Jet Relay Configuration All Wayk Bastion commands accept a -ConfigPath parameter to point to a directory where various configuration files are kept. If this parameter is not specified, the current working directory is used by default. The first step is to create a Wayk Bastion configuration file with mandatory parameters using the New-WaykBastionConfig command. You need to choose a realm for your Wayk Bastion, such as \"contoso.net\". This realm does not need to be a valid DNS domain name, but it will become your Wayk Bastion realm used in various places, including the peer-to-peer certificates generated by the Wayk Bastion built-in certificate authority. The second mandatory parameter is the external URL at which the Wayk Bastion will be exposed. We recommend using the \"den\" subdomain under the domain of your choice, such as \"den.contoso.net\". The protocol prefix ( http:// or https:// ) also needs to be included. Create a new Wayk Bastion configuration file, using \"contoso.net\" as realm and \"https://den.contoso.net\" as the external url: PS > New-WaykBastionConfig -Realm contoso.net -ExternalUrl https://den.contoso.net -ListenerUrl http://localhost:4000 The listener url is used to specify the listening protocol and port on the machine where Wayk Bastion is running. To listen in https, a certificate needs to be imported before changing the listener URL protocol. Initial Setup When accessing the Web UI for the first time, login using the default username (\"wayk-admin\") and password (\"wayk-admin\"): You will then be asked to create your first admin account to replace the default one: It should also be noted that you can access the Wayk Bastion Web UI locally through the configured listener URL ( http://localhost:4000 by default) for convenience, as an intermediate step before configuring the external URL. Certificate configuration To expose Wayk Bastion to the external world, you will need a TLS certificate from a trusted certificate authority such as Let's Encrypt . Wayk will validate certificates in the same way as a browser does for a website. If you wish to make your own certificate authority, the Root CA certificate will need to be installed in each machine’s certificate trust store. If the system browser can validate it, Wayk should be able to validate it as well, it’s just a lot more work. Before going any further, check the following points: The certificate name matches your configured external URL. This means that if your external URL is \"https://den.contoso.com\" then your certificate name should be \"den.contoso.com\" or \"*.contoso.com\" if you have a wildcard certificate. The certificate is either in pem + key or pfx (PKCS#12) format. The private key password is only supported for the pfx format. The certificate file contains the certificate chain excluding the Root CA. This means that in most cases, you should have a leaf certificate, followed by one or more intermediate certificates. If validation works in a browser but not in Wayk, the intermediate certificate is likely missing. The PEM format is the simplest to work with, since it is the Base64 representation of the DER-encoded certificate in between \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\" and \"-----END CERTIFICATE-----\" tags. To add the intermediate certificate to the certificate file, just append it after your leaf certificate in a text editor. PS > Import-WaykBastionCertificate -CertificateFile /path/to/certificate.pem -PrivateKeyFile /path/to/private_key.key PS > Import-WaykBastionCertificate -CertificateFile /path/to/certificate.pfx -Password <password> Running Start Wayk Bastion, and wait for all containers to start: Start-WaykBastion Once started, Wayk Bastion listens on http://localhost:4000 by default. Alternatively, if you want to see the complete docker commands executed by the \"Start-WaykBastion\" command, you can use the -Verbose parameter: Start-WaykBastion -Verbose You can check that all containers are up and running with the docker ps -f network=den-network command. To confirm everything is correctly configured, you should be able to get a response from the Wayk Bastion well known configuration endpoint: curl http://localhost:4000/.well-known/configuration {\"den_router_uri\":\"https://den.contoso.net/cow\",\"lucid_uri\":\"https://den.contoso.net/lucid\",\"realm\":\"contoso.net\",\"wayk_client_id\":\"zqdvSbCRWdDrj1fQXwzPQbCg\"} If you have correctly configured external access, you should be able to get the same response using the external configuration URL ( https://den.contoso.net/.well-known/configuration ). Stop Wayk Bastion, and wait for all containers to stop: Stop-WaykBastion System Service It is possible to register a system service on Windows to automatically call Start-WaykBastion / Stop-WaykBastion in a given config directory. Instead of using a local user directory for the configuration files, the service should be installed in a global directory with restricted permissions like this: PS > $ConfigPath = Get-WaykBastionPath ConfigPath PS > $ConfigPath C:\\ProgramData\\Devolutions\\Wayk Bastion PS > New-Item -Path $ConfigPath -Type Directory -Force The \"Get-WaykBastionPath ConfigPath\" command returns the recommended directory for the current platform where files should be stored. If you already have a directory with your Wayk Bastion configuration files, you should move them to the new location. You can then proceed with the service registration: PS > Set-Location $ConfigPath PS > Register-WaykBastionService -ServicePath $ConfigPath \"WaykBastion\" service has been installed to \"C:\\ProgramData\\Devolutions\\Wayk Bastion\" PS > Get-Service WaykBastion Status Name DisplayName ------ ---- ----------- Stopped WaykBastion Wayk Bastion PS > Start-Service WaykBastion Wait for the service to start, this can take some time. If you look at the files in the directory, you should see \"WaykBastion.exe\", which is the service executable, and \"WaykBastion.log\", the service log file: PS > Get-ChildItem Directory: C:\\ProgramData\\Devolutions\\Wayk Bastion Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- d----- 4/2/2020 5:21 PM den-server d----- 4/2/2020 5:06 PM traefik -a---- 4/7/2020 4:34 PM 314 service.json -a---- 4/2/2020 5:06 PM 909 wayk-den.yml -a---- 4/2/2020 5:33 PM 770048 WaykBastion.exe -a---- 4/7/2020 4:07 PM 2753 WaykBastion.log If you encounter issues with Wayk Bastion not working as expected when launched through the system service, the best way to debug the issue is to go in the same directory as the service and run the \"Start-WaykBastion\" command manually to see what happens. The system service is a wrapper over the cmdlet. If you need to remove it, you can call the Unregister-WaykBastionService function: Unregister-WaykBastionService -ServicePath $ConfigPath You can also update the service wrapper executable when never versions of the cmdlet are published by calling Register-WaykBastionService again."

This can be particularly interesting for small organizations as JumpCloud has a free tier for up to 10 users. To get started, you will need to create a JumpCloud organization , and an LDAP reader account that will be used by Wayk Bastion for synchronization. For each of your regular users, the LDAP Bind DN feature must be enabled for LDAP authentication to work: It is recommended to create a \"wayk-users\" group containing all the users that should be synchronized in Wayk Bastion. The LDAP reader account is not a regular user account, it has to be configured as part of JumpCloud's LDAP-as-a-service functionality . This account is restricted to reading information from LDAP and cannot be used for regular authentication. Once this is done, you will need to find your LDAP organization ID: You will also need the LDAP distinguished name for the LDAP reader account: With all this information in hand, naviguate to Settings , then Account Provider in the Wayk Bastion interface. Select JumpCloud as the server type, then enter the following, replacing the values with your own: Server URL : ldaps://ldap.jumpcloud.com:636 User Group : wayk-users Username : UID=admin,OU=Users,O=5cfea4a811f5c961d4e942b8,DC=jumpcloud,DC=com Password : (ldap reader password) Base Distinguished Name : OU=Users,O=5cfea4a811f5c961d4e942b8,DC=jumpcloud,DC=com Use the Test LDAP Configuration button to validate the configuration, then save it using the Save button at the top right of the screen.

While this may be good enough for most, a regular MongoDB installation is preferable, especially if high availability is required. MongoDB Server Download the MongoDB .msi installer for Windows . Launch the .msi installer, then click Next. Accept the license agreement, then click Next. Leave the default options, then click Next. If you wish to install MongoDB Compass, check \"Install MongoDB Compass\", then click Next. While it is a very convenient MongoDB GUI, it can take several minutes to install.

That's it, you should now have a \"MongoDB\" system service started automatically, with files stored under \"C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\4.4\\bin\". Network Configuration Once the MongoDB server is installed, a few configuration settings need to be tweaked to make it usable from the containers. Open the mongod.cfg configuration file located inside the 'bin' directory of the MongoDB server with a text editor, then look for the following section : # network interfaces net: port: 27017 bindIp: 127.0.0.1 Change 'bindIp: 127.0.0.1' to 'bindIpAll: true', then save the changes: # network interfaces net: port: 27017 bindIpAll: true Restart the MongoDB service for the changes to be applied: Restart-Service MongoDB This change is necessary because Windows container use a special network interface to communicate with the host. MongoDB tools In order to perform MongoDB management on the host, you will need to install the MongoDB management tools . chocolatey You can install the MongoDB database tools with chocolatey: choco install mongodb-database-tools This is the recommended installation method, as it automatically adds to the tools to the system PATH. .msi installer Download the .msi installer or equivalent package for your platform: Once installed, the tools should be located in directory that looks like \"C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Tools\\100\\bin\".

We will use the hostname 'MongoHost' but it needs to be replaced by the real name of your host to work within Wayk Bastion containers: $MongoHost = \"MongoHost\" Stop-WaykBastion Set-WaykBastionConfig -MongoExternal $True -MongoUrl \"mongodb://${MongoHost}:27017\" Start-WaykBastion If the 'den-mongo' container was not stopped prior to the configuration change, it may still be running. You can stop it with \"docker stop den-mongo\" if it is the case. If everything worked well, all containers expect 'den-mongo' should be up and running. If some containers failed to started due to MongoDB connection errors, verify the following: The MongoUrl parameter points to a reachable host where the MongoDB server is running The MongoDB server configuration file (mongod.cfg) was modified with 'bindIpAll: true' The firewall is not blocking connections on TCP/27017 in between containers and the host Otherwise, congratulations: Wayk Bastion is now correctly configured to use an external MongoDB server!"

The best is to create an elevated pwsh process only when required, an exit it once it is not no longer needed. macOS Wayk Bastion is not officially supported on macOS, but Wayk Client and Wayk Agent definitely are. Follow the official instructions to install PowerShell on macOS . The most straightforward installation method is to use Homebrew : brew install --cask powershell"

    "keywords": "Wayk PowerShell Remoting Requirements PowerShell 7 Wayk PowerShell remoting requires PowerShell 7 on both sides: The local machine running Wayk Client The target machine running Wayk Agent Windows PowerShell 5.1 cannot be used for Wayk PowerShell remoting. Install PowerShell 7 and then make sure that \"pwsh\" is available in your PATH as opposed to \"powershell\". PowerShell Module The WaykClient PowerShell module is needed to launch a Wayk PowerShell session from PowerShell: Install-Module WaykClient Once the WaykClient PowerShell module is installed, you can import it, and list the commands it contains to get started: Import-Module WaykClient Get-Command -Module WaykClient Wayk Client This may look obvious, but it is important to know that the regular Wayk Client application needs to be installed, configured and logged in to Wayk Bastion before using Wayk PowerShell remoting. The WaykClient PowerShell module does not make its own separate connection to Wayk Bastion, it simply calls the existing Wayk Client program to initiate the connection to the target machine. Wayk PowerShell remoting in the Wayk Client is supported on Windows, macOS and Linux, as long as PowerShell 7 is installed. Wayk Agent Wayk PowerShell remoting in the Wayk Agent is supported on Windows, macOS and Linux. Again, PowerShell 7 must be installed on the target machine , as the built-in Windows PowerShell 5.1 cannot be used. Launching Connection Start by reviewing the following points: The Wayk Client application is running and logged in Wayk Bastion, as if ready to launch a Wayk remote desktop connection. PowerShell 7 is installed on both sides: Wayk Client (local machine) and Wayk Agent (target machine). Open a PowerShell terminal, make sure that it is running PowerShell 7 or later, then import the WaykClient PowerShell module: PS > $PSVersionTable.PSVersion.ToString() 7.1.0 PS > Import-Module WaykClient Create a new PSCredential object using the Get-Credential command with valid credentials for the target machine: PS > $Credential = Get-Credential PowerShell credential request Enter your credentials. User: wayk-admin Password for user wayk-admin: ******** You can now use the Enter-WaykPSSession command to launch a remote session: PS > $HostName = 'tailspin101' PS > Enter-WaykPSSession -HostName $HostName -Credential $Credential [tailspin101]: PS > [Environment]::MachineName TAILSPIN101 An alternative way to connect is using the New-WaykPSSession command to obtain the PSSession object without necessarily entering the session interactively: PS > $HostName = 'tailspin101' PS > $Session = New-WaykPSSession -HostName $HostName -Credential $Credential PS > Invoke-Command -Session $Session { [Environment]::MachineName } TAILSPIN101 PS > Enter-WaykPSSession -Session $Session [tailspin101]: PS > PowerShell Remoting Internals If you want to learn more about how it works under the hood, you can do the steps manually using Connect-WaykPSSession , which modifies the current environment prior to calling the regular Enter-PSSession or New-PSSession commands: PS > $UserName = 'wayk-admin' PS > $Password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String \"wayk123!\" -AsPlainText -Force PS > $Credential = [PSCredential]::New($UserName, $Password) PS > $HostName = 'tailspin101' PS > Connect-WaykPSSession -HostName $HostName -Credential $Credential PS > Enter-PSSession -HostName $HostName -UserName $UserName [tailspin101]: PS > After a successful Connect-WaykPSSession call, the current PATH environment variable has modified modified to point to a special SSH replacement executable meant to connect to an ephemeral WebSocket URL. Wayk PowerShell remoting uses the SSH transport without SSH, so you don't even need to have real OpenSSH client or server installed. In fact, here's proof: [tailspin101]: PS > Get-WindowsCapability -Online | ? Name -Like 'OpenSSH.Server*' Name : OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0 State : NotPresent [tailspin101]: PS > Get-Service sshd Get-Service: Cannot find any service with service name 'sshd'. For a detailed explanation of how this is possible, read the PowerShell Remoting Over SSH, Without SSH! blog post. Interacting with GUI Applications Regular PowerShell remoting does not allow interaction with GUI applications, but Wayk PowerShell remoting is perfectly capable of it. To try it out, open a remote desktop session to target using Wayk or RDP, and then connect to the same target machine with the same user using Wayk PowerShell remoting. You can then use Start-Process to launch GUI applications in the same user session from the Wayk PowerShell remoting session: [tailspin101]: PS > Start-Process 'notepad' [tailspin101]: PS > Start-Process 'calc' You should normally see those programs appear in the remote desktop session, which is not something that can be done with regular PowerShell remoting: If interacting with GUI applications over Wayk PowerShell remoting is a feature of interest to you, please let us know by commenting on our forums ."
